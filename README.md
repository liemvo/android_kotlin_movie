# Android Kotlin Movie

This is the android movie application with the database of themoviedb. I will apply some techniques: Hilt, Android Jetpack (Navigation, lifecycle, databinding), Coroutine, and MVVM pattern.

## Setup the movie db key

* Register the new application from the movie db [website](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* Create file name `key.properties` in the root of this project
* Add a key `moviesKey` with the value is the API key from the movie db website to the `key.properties`

You have setup your own key for using in this project.
